JWST/NIRCam photometry of the globular cluster candidates in SMACS J0723.3-7327 at z = 0.39 (Lee et al. 2022, ApJ,***,***). DAOPHOT (Stetson 1987) was used to detect point sources in the stacked frame images of SMACS J0723.3-7327 in the F150W and F200W filters. The globular cluster candidates have the color and magnitude ranges of  -0.2 < (F150W-F200W)_0 < 0.6, and 26.5 < F200W_0 < 29.5 mag, respectively. The photometry is calibrated to the AB magnitude system using the pre-flight version of the JWST catalog.
